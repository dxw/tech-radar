    Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose,
    also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our
    dxw production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used
- name: TRIAL
  color: "#93d2c2"
  description: |
    Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work
    to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm
    benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly
    more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and
    will share knowledge and experiences
- name: ASSESS
  color: "#fbdb84"
  description: |
    Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add
    for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping
    efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher
    risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation.
    You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and
    promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort

    Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies
    that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies
    should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for
    existing projects
