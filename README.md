# dxw Tech Radar

A page to organise our collective thinking around technologies we use, and how that evolves over time.

## Adding content

To add new entries to the radar, or adjust an existing one, open a PR with an edit to [`_data/entries.csv`](https://github.com/dxw/tech-radar/blob/main/_data/entries.yml).

The [quadrants](https://github.com/dxw/tech-radar/blob/main/_data/quadrants.yml) and [rings](https://github.com/dxw/tech-radar/blob/main/_data/rings.yml), along with their descriptions, are also defined in data files, so changes can be proposed fairly easily.

## Development

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com); to run it locally:

* `bundle`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

And visit http://localhost:4000
