# dxw Tech Radar

A page to organise our collective thinking around technologies we use, and how that evolves over time.

## Adding content

To add new entries to the radar, or adjust an existing one, open a PR with an edit to `_data/entries.csv`.

## Development

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com); to run it locally:

* `bundle`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

And visit http://localhost:4000
